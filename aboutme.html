            <p>
                Born and raised in Benicia, California. I started programming at the
            age of 12, a self-taught developer driven by curiosity and a deep
            interest in computers and technology. i&apos;ve dedicated myself to
            learning and mastering various programming languages, frameworks,
            and libraries. I plan to obtain a master&apos;s degree in computer
            science during my enrollment in college, and pursue a career in
            software engineering.
