                    My portfolio website showcases my expertise as a
                    developer through a collection of interactive projects,
                    highlighting my skills in both frontend and backend
                    development. Built with Next.js, it features a sleek,
                    modern design optimized for performance and user
                    experience. The site is fully responsive, offering
                    smooth navigation across devices, and includes dynamic
                    content like project showcases, blogs, and a contact
                    form. The design is minimalist, ensuring that the focus
                    remains on the functionality of my work, and it’s
                    enhanced by animations and transitions for a polished
                    look.

                This online Texas Hold’em poker game offers a real-time,
                interactive experience for players. The frontend, developed
                with Next.js, ensures fast, responsive gameplay with smooth
                animations and a user-friendly interface. On the backend, I
                used Rust, which brings the performance and security needed
                for real-time multiplayer interactions. The game supports
                features like in-game chat, player avatars, and a live
                leaderboard, creating a highly engaging environment.
                Designed to scale efficiently, it can handle multiple
                simultaneous games and players, ensuring a seamless
                experience for poker enthusiasts of all skill levels.
